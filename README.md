# Cinelovers
To practice my iOS development skill I created this app using the best practices of UX/UI design, TDD and Restful APIs, getting data from TMDb API. This app is compatible on the iPhone and iPad both on the portrait as well as landscape.

## Build Instructions
### Cocoapods
I used the [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) as a dependency manager. So to build the project we need to run the following line after installing the [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org):

    pod install

### Xcode 10.2.1
To build this project we need the XCode version 10.2.1 or later.

## Libraries
Some third-party libraries were used to improve the UX and performance, like that:
### iCarousel (https://github.com/nicklockwood/iCarousel)
To create an amazing user experience I used this library to show some movies highlighted.  

### Kingfisher (https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)
To have a good performance on download and cache images I used this library.

### Alamofire (https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
Alamofire library was used to have the best HTTP communication.
